In this project I will try to predict if a Kickstarter campaign will go to its goal or not.

This project has been made in Spark-Scala Course at **Telecom-ParisTech** in 2017-2018.

In order to run it, you must have spark-shell installed

You must have train.csv at the same level of this project to make be able to:

```
build ./build_and_submit.sh Preprocessor
```
Then you can run:
```
build ./build_and_submit.sh Trainer
```
